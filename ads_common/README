= Google AdsCommon Library

This gem is a dependency for the new generation of Ruby Google Ads client
libraries. It contains common code shared among all of these libraries, such as
authentication, SOAP stub generation, error handling, logging, etc.

This is an early preview release, so a lot of things are still missing!
