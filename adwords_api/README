= Google AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer Client Library

Welcome to the next generation Google-developed Ruby client library for the
AdWords and DoubleClick Ad Exchange Buyer API!

Please note that this is an early PREVIEW of the client library, still under
development.

It contains full support for v201109, with full stubs, and a simplified
programming interface that lets you handle everything in native Ruby
collections.


= Docs for Users

== 1 - Installation:

google-adwords-api and google-adx-buyer-api are ruby gems.
  See http://docs.rubygems.org/read/book/1

Install them using the gem install command:
   $ gem install --remote google-adwords-api
   $ gem install --remote google-adx-buyer-api

Please note the google-adx-buyer-api gem contains only DoubleClick Ad Exchange
Buyer client library examples. You need the AdWords library in order to use it
which is installed automatically as a dependency.

The following gem libraries are required:
  - savon v0.9.7
  - google-ads-common v0.6.3 or later.


== 2 - Using the client library:

Include the library with 'require':
   require 'adwords_api'

Then create an API instance:
   adwords = AdwordsApi::Api.new

The created API object will grant you access to all the services for all of the
currently supported vesions of the APIs. It uses a config file in:
  ENV['HOME']/adwords_api.yml to read all of your configurations by default.

There is an example configuration file shipped with these libraries.

You can also pass API a manually constructed config hash like:
   adwords = AdwordsApi::Api.new({
     :authentication => {
         :method => 'ClientLogin',
         :developer_token => 'DEVELOPER_TOKEN',
         :user_agent => 'Ruby Sample',
         :password => 'PASSWORD',
         :email => 'user@domain.com',
         :client_customer_id => '012-345-6789'
     },
     :service => {
       :environment => 'PRODUCTION'
     }
   })

Then, just specify which service you're looking to use, and which version:
   campaign_srv = adwords.service(:CampaignService, :v201109)

and you should now be able to just use the API methods in the object you were
returned:
   # Get 'Id', 'Name' and 'Status' fields of all campaigns.
   campaigns = campaign_srv.get({:fields => ['Id', 'Name', 'Status']})

See the code in the examples directory for working examples you can build from.

*Note*: if your setup requires you to send connections through a proxy server,
please set the appropriate options in the config file or config hash. E.g.:
   config[:connection] = {
     :proxy => 'http://user:password@proxy_hostname:8080'
   }

*Note*: if you are using Ruby 1.8 you may need to include RubyGems to be able
to require other gems code. There are several ways to do it, the easiest one is
to pass '-rubygems' parameter to the ruby interpreter:
   $ ruby -rubygems my_program_that_uses_gems

you can also set this up in the environment:
   $ export RUBYOPT="rubygems"

or add it to the bash configuration file:
   $ echo 'export RUBYOPT="rubygems"' >> ~/.bashrc


=== 2.1 - Ruby names for a Ruby library:

In order to make things more Ruby-like for our Ruby developers, we've renamed
API objects and methods to more closely match Ruby conventions. This means using
snake_case for methods and parameters, and UpperCamelCase for class names.

For example, the 'getReportFields' method of the ReportDefinitionService is
named 'get_report_fields' in the client library. You invoke it by doing:
   response = report_def_srv.get_report_fields(report_type)

The 'get' method, on the other hand, returns a ReportDefinitionPage object which
has an 'entries' and a 'total_num_entries' field. So, to access the return
values, you would do:
   response = report_def_srv.get(selector)
   num_entries = response[:total_num_entries]

Essentially, all you have to do is follow Ruby conventions, and the library will
do the rest. All of the examples are written following this standard.


=== 2.2 - Using the Sandbox:

In order to use the sandbox, make sure that the 'environment' parameter under
'service' in the configuration is set to Sandbox.
   config[:service] = {
     :environment => 'SANDBOX'
   }


=== 2.3 - Logging:

It is often useful to see a trace of the raw SOAP XML being sent and received.
The quickest way of achieving this when debugging your application is by setting
the library.log_level configuration variable to 'DEBUG':
   config[:library] = {
     :log_level => 'DEBUG'
   }
or via configuration file (see example).

This will output the SOAP XML to stderr, which will usually show up in your
terminal window.

There's also an option of logging requests and XML to a file. In order to enable
this, you should create a standard Logger object and pass it to the library:
   require 'logger'
   logger = Logger.new('path/to/log_filename')
   logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
   adwords = AdwordsApi::Api.new
   adwords.logger = logger

Request details and units spend are logged at the INFO log level, while raw HTTP
headers and XML dumps are logged at the DEBUG log level. For more details on
using Logger refer to the Ruby Logger documentation.

=== 2.4 - Calculating unit spend:

Each AdWords API operation performed consumes a certain number of API units, as
specified in the rate sheet:
  http://code.google.com/apis/adwords/docs/ratesheet.html

The amount of units spent is returned in the header part of the SOAP response.
This information can be obtained by passing a user block during method call:
  response = report_def_srv.get(selector) do |header|
    puts "Units spent: %d" % header[:units]
  end

You can also retrieve the response body as the second block parameter:
  report_def_srv.get(selector) {|header, body| ... }

=== 2.5 - GZip compression

The library offers a transparent compression option which can be enabled in the
configuration file or by the following setting:

   config[:connection] = {
     :enable_gzip => true
   }

Enabling this option will set the headers required to request the server to
respond in gzipped format. All requests are sent uncompressed regardless.
